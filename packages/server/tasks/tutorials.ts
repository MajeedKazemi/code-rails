The print statement in Python is like telling the computer to speak out loud or write something down for you. It’s a way to send messages from your code to the screen, so you can see what’s happening.

## Basic Usage
\`\`\`python
print("Hello World!")
\`\`\`
This line tells the computer to display the words “Hello, World!” on the screen.

## Examples:
\`\`\`python
print(3 + 4)
\`\`\`
This will first run the expression \`3 + 4\` (which will be 7), and then will show 7 on the screen. d
\`\`\`python
print("I am learning Python.")
\`\`\`
This will display the sentence “I am learning Python.”

## Tips:
You can print numbers, words, or even the results of calculations.
Use quotes (" ") around words or sentences you want to print.`
